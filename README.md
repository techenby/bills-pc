# Pokémon Trading Card Game Dex

Keep track of your Pokémon card collection, decks and more.

## ToDo
- Sort by type
- Better Keyboard access, i.e. Tab to focus/hover on cards in search
- Virtual/Physical Cards
- If you can build a deck (virtually or physically)
- Check if a deck is valid
- Landing page
- Add by image (scan card on phone, look up matches then add to collection)
- Collection or Dex? Which makes more sense?
- Duplicate Dex or Deck Versions?
